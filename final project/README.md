# Password Storage
final project for a class about Python. 
It's an application that opens up with an admin password, and you have to know this beforehand. Its hard coded within the code itself. This unlocks access to keywords to obtain passwords related to those key words. For example; using the key word chase will return the password from the users chase account. If its the users first time using that key word it will prompt the user to enter a password related to that key word. All of this is safe because I used an encyrption method known as visionary cypher.
